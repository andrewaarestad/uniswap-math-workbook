# Uniswap Math Workbook

This is a playground I created to experiment with Uniswap math.  Specifically, I wanted to explore why I was seeing transactions unexpectedly revert with "Uniswap:K".

## Usage

* create a `.env` file in the root folder and add:
  * ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
  * ALCHEMY_API_KEY
* `npm i -g hardhat-shorthand`
* `hh test`
